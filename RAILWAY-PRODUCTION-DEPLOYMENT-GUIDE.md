## üöÄ **Deployment Execution**

### **Step 1: Pre-deployment Verification**
```bash
# Check current deployment status
railway status

# Verify all environment variables
railway variables list

# Test local application
npm run build
npm start
```

### **Step 2: Zero Downtime Deployment**
```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy intelligent features to Railway production"

# Execute Railway deployment
node deploy-to-railway-production.js
```

### **Alternative Manual Deployment**
```bash
# Manual Railway deployment
railway deploy

# Monitor deployment progress
railway logs --follow
```

---

## üîç **Deployment Verification**

### **Health Checks**
```bash
# Get Railway deployment URL
RAILWAY_URL=$(railway status --json | jq -r '.deployment.url')

# Test health endpoint
curl $RAILWAY_URL/api/health

# Test intelligent features endpoints
curl $RAILWAY_URL/api/intelligent-features/status
curl $RAILWAY_URL/api/feature-flags/flags
```

### **Feature Testing**
```bash
# Test business classification
curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/intelligent-features/classify-business \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"businessInfo": "Software development company"}'

# Test cost validation
curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/intelligent-features/validate-costs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"costs": {"monthly": 5000, "category": "software"}}'

# Test recommendations
curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/intelligent-features/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"analysisData": {"revenue": 100000, "costs": 80000}}'
```

### **Performance Verification**
```bash
# Monitor application logs
railway logs --tail 100

# Check application metrics (if available)
railway metrics

# Monitor database performance
railway connect
\dt+ -- List tables with sizes
```

---

## üîÑ **Rollback Procedures**

### **Immediate Rollback (< 2 minutes)**
```bash
# Execute rollback script (created by deployment)
./rollback-railway-production.sh

# Or manual rollback:
git checkout HEAD~1  # Go to previous commit
railway deploy
```

### **Environment Variable Rollback**
```bash
# Disable intelligent features immediately
railway variables set ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_FEATURES=false
railway variables set ENABLE_BUSINESS_CLASSIFICATION=false
railway variables set ENABLE_COST_VALIDATION=false
railway variables set ENABLE_RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE=false

# Railway will redeploy automatically
```

### **Database Rollback (if needed)**
```bash
# Connect to database
railway connect

# Run rollback queries to remove new tables (if needed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS business_classifications CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cost_validations CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recommendations CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS feature_usage_analytics CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS performance_metrics CASCADE;
```
