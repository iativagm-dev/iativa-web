## 💰 Cost Validation & Smart Alerts

### What Cost Validation Does
Our AI continuously monitors your cost entries and alerts you when something seems unusual or potentially incorrect.

### Types of Alerts

#### 🔴 **Critical Alerts**
**What you'll see:** Red warning with "Critical Cost Issue Detected"
**Meaning:** Something is significantly wrong
**Examples:**
- Labor cost entered as $500,000 for a small business
- Material costs 10x higher than industry average
- Negative cost values

**What to do:** Stop and double-check your entry immediately

#### 🟡 **Warning Alerts**
**What you'll see:** Yellow caution with "Cost Validation Warning"
**Meaning:** Unusual but possibly correct
**Examples:**
- Costs 2-3x higher than typical for your business type
- Unusual cost category for your industry
- Seasonal variations

**What to do:** Review the entry - it might be correct but worth verifying

#### ℹ️ **Information Alerts**
**What you'll see:** Blue info icon with helpful suggestions
**Meaning:** Helpful tips for optimization
**Examples:**
- "Similar businesses typically spend 15% less on materials"
- "Consider bulk purchasing for better rates"
- "Labor costs align with industry standards"

### Understanding Alert Messages

**Example Alert:**
```
⚠️ Cost Validation Warning
Material costs seem high for a Technology business
Industry Average: $15,000/month
Your Entry: $45,000/month
💡 Suggestion: Consider bulk purchasing discounts or supplier negotiations
```

### How We Validate Costs

1. **Industry Benchmarks** - Compare against thousands of similar businesses
2. **Historical Patterns** - Look at your past entries for consistency
3. **Ratio Analysis** - Check if cost proportions make sense
4. **Seasonal Adjustments** - Account for business cycles
5. **Regional Factors** - Consider location-based cost differences

## 📊 Coherence Scores Explained

### What is a Coherence Score?
Think of it as a "consistency grade" for your business data. It measures how well all your information fits together logically.

### Score Ranges

| Score | Grade | Meaning | Action Needed |
|-------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **90-100** | A+ 🟢 | Excellent - Everything fits perfectly | None - you're all set! |
| **80-89** | A 🟢 | Very good - Minor inconsistencies | Review flagged items |
| **70-79** | B 🟡 | Good - Some areas need attention | Address warnings |
| **60-69** | C 🟠 | Fair - Several inconsistencies found | Review and correct issues |
| **Below 60** | D-F 🔴 | Poor - Significant problems detected | Major review needed |

### What Affects Your Coherence Score?

#### ✅ **Positive Factors:**
- Consistent business type across all information
- Costs that match industry standards
- Logical relationships between different data points
- Complete and detailed information
- Realistic growth projections

#### ❌ **Negative Factors:**
- Conflicting business type indicators
- Costs that seem unrealistic or inconsistent
- Missing important information
- Contradictory data in different sections
- Unrealistic projections

### Example Coherence Report
```
📊 Coherence Score: 87/100 (Very Good)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 🏢 **Business Type Detection**

**Q: The system detected the wrong business type. What should I do?**
A: You can manually correct it in your business profile settings. The system will learn from your correction and improve future detections.

**Q: Why is my confidence score low?**
A: Low confidence usually means your business has mixed characteristics or is in a niche industry. Provide more detailed descriptions to help our AI understand your business better.

**Q: Can I have multiple business types?**
A: Yes! Many businesses operate in multiple sectors. The system will detect your primary type and note secondary categories.

### 💰 **Cost Validation**

**Q: I keep getting cost alerts, but my numbers are correct. What's happening?**
A: This can happen if your business is unique or operates in a specialized niche. You can mark costs as "verified" to train the system, or contact support for industry-specific calibration.

**Q: Do cost alerts mean I'm doing something wrong?**
A: Not at all! Alerts are helpful suggestions. If your costs are genuinely higher due to quality choices, location, or other factors, that's perfectly fine.

**Q: Can I turn off cost validation alerts?**
A: Yes, you can adjust alert sensitivity or turn off specific types of alerts in your preferences. However, we recommend keeping at least critical alerts enabled.

### 📊 **Coherence Scores**

**Q: My coherence score is 65. Is that bad?**
A: A score of 65 means "Fair" - there are some inconsistencies, but nothing critical. Focus on the specific issues highlighted in your report to improve.

**Q: Why did my coherence score drop after adding more information?**
A: Sometimes additional information reveals inconsistencies that weren't apparent before. This is actually good - it helps identify areas that need attention.

**Q: How often is my coherence score updated?**
A: It's recalculated in real-time as you make changes to your business information.

### 🎯 **Recommendations**

**Q: How personalized are the recommendations?**
A: Very! They're based on your specific business type, size, industry, location, and current performance. No two businesses get identical recommendations.

**Q: Can I disagree with a recommendation?**
A: Absolutely! You can mark recommendations as "not applicable" or "not interested." This helps our AI learn your preferences.

**Q: How often do I get new recommendations?**
A: The system generates new recommendations as your business data changes and evolves. Typically, you'll see updates monthly or when you make significant changes.

**Q: Are the savings estimates realistic?**
A: Our estimates are based on real results from similar businesses. However, your actual results may vary depending on implementation and market conditions.

### ⚡ **Performance & Speed**

**Q: Why are results so much faster now?**
A: We use advanced caching and prediction algorithms that anticipate what you need and pre-compute common analyses. This reduces processing time by up to 90%.

**Q: Sometimes results are instant, other times they take a few seconds. Why?**
A: Instant results come from our intelligent cache. When we need to perform fresh calculations (for new or unique scenarios), it takes a bit longer but is still much faster than before.

### 🔧 **Technical Questions**

**Q: Do I need to do anything different to use the intelligent features?**
A: No! They work automatically in the background. Just use the system as you normally would, and you'll see the enhanced results.

**Q: Is my data secure with AI analysis?**
A: Absolutely. All AI processing happens securely, and your data is never shared or used to train models for other businesses.

**Q: What if the intelligent features aren't working?**
A: The system automatically falls back to standard processing if AI features are unavailable. You'll still get results, just without the intelligent enhancements.
